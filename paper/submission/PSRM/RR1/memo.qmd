  Memo to Editor and Reviewers
---

Thank you for the Editor and reviewers' helpful comments and suggestions.
We have made specific revisions corresponding to your helpful comments and constructive suggestions for improvement.
Here we set out a list of the specific points raised in the reviews and our responses to them below, roughly in the order they appear in the text:

1. **Identification of "data-entry errors"**.
	Both the editor and two reviewers raised concerns about "data-entry errors."
	Editor and Reviewer 2 (R2) are skeptical about to what extent the issue we identified can be attributed to "data-entry errors" rather than other types of mistakes.
	We agree with this concern and add a paragraph on p.2 to address this issue specifically. 
	In particular, we point out that it is impossible to tell with complete certainty the exact reason for the issues we identify, since the authors' intentions are not detectable from the outcomes. 
	We are rather willing to attribute these issues to some type of "errors" than accuse them of p-hacking or other types of intensive manipulations. 
	Nor the point we raise here is to criticize certain particular background reasons, but to conduct "typical robustness challenges"---as @JanzFreese2021[p.306] suggested a good replication should do---and illuminate how idiosyncratic manual data entry processes can cause problems.
	
	Reviewer 1 (R1) also reminded us to exercise caution when discussing the implications, considering that our research begins with the replication of a single study. 
	We appreciate this prudence and have incorporated it into the manuscript (pp. 2 and 12). 
	On one hand, we explicitly advise readers to recognize that our suggestions are based on the experience with a specific study and should not be seen as a universal remedy for data processing issues across all types of studies. 
	On the other hand, we hope readers will view these recommendations as an effort to foster more reliable and transparent research. 
	In this sense, the insights we provide can extend beyond the confines of the specific case, topic, or even discipline.

1. **Concern of promoting the "automated data entry"**.
	Reviewer 1 (R1) has raised a valid concern regarding our promotion of "automated data entry" based on a single-case study. 
	We take this concern seriously and agree with R1 that the automation of data entry may not be suitable for all types of studies. 
	It is also important to note that our suggestion does not imply the superiority of machines over humans in all scenarios. 
	We address these points the discussion of our first recommendation on p. 10, explicitly highlighting the specific problems that data-entry automation aims to solve and those that it does not.
	We would also like to express our gratitude to R1 for suggesting @Weidmann2023 which offers a more systematic survey of the strengths of data-entry automation. 
	We have acknowledged the existence of these studies in our manuscript (pp. 10-11), providing readers with additional resources to explore.
	

1. **Connection with the broad Open-Science literature**.
	We appreciate the editor and reviewers pushing us to talk with the more general literature of open science and "data analytics that are robust and trusted"(DART). 
	We state the connections at the beginning of the manuscript (p.2) and discuss it more explicitly at the end (pp.11--12).
	We exhibit the shared logic of this research and recommendations with the growing effort in political science to produce transparent and reliable research and connection with the more general open-science movement.
	We also thank R2 to suggest branches of relevant literature both in and out of political science.
